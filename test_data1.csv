walmart has become the perfect symbol of the corporate greed strangling much of the planet from putting tens of thousands of mom and pop stores out of business unionbusting gender wage discrimination and utilizing slave labor in developing nations walmart has used its power to make the lives of millions of people miserable and that s before you include leeching billions in taxpayer money by forcing their workers to live off of government assistance all so a handful of billionaires can get even richerbut it looks like unrestrained greed can only get you so farfor the first time ever or at least since the company went public some years ago walmart s revenues shrank from the year before according to its annual financial filing released wednesdaywalmart is clearly having trouble adapting its gigantic stores to the internet age to be sure it is a retail juggernaut that brings in half a trillion dollars that s right trillion in sales every year and with more than stores in countriesthere s no way it will disappear anytime soon though walmart shares were a safe haven in the rocky start of investors are pricing in more weakness the stock has fallen behind retail competitors and the broader marketin february walmart lowered its annual net sales growth forecast to relatively flat from earlier guidance that called for an increase of as much as percent the company has pointed out that previous guidance didn t account for currency changes which have stung the global retailerironically part of this drop in revenue is due to walmart focusing less on cutting operating expenses like those pesky salaries that workers are always complaining about and actual increased the pay for million workers earlier this yearwhile a republican might point to this and scream aha proof that paying the peons i mean valuable employees more is bad for business less insane people would point out that a workforce of million people that have more money will almost certainly spend some of that money at a store that carries most of the stuff they need like for instance walmartthese hypothetical less crazy people might also point out that paying million people more money would boost the economy and that a healthier economy means more people have more money to spend at places like for instance again walmart because let s be honest walmart is not paying more out of the goodness of its cold calculating corporate heartit s too much to hope that the embodiment of everything wrong with unrestrained capitalism will go out of business and frankly that would be an unemployment disaster but we can hope for a steady decline and then a collapse i would also be happy if walmart s board simply had an epiphany that crushing the middle class is not a viable long term strategy sure paying a living wage would mean the shareholders would make less money but if the alternative is eventually going out of business because there s not enough demand it would be more than worth the short term stingeither way let s hope this dip in revenue is the start of something good for america and the worldfeatured image via ai archives,0
"randy johnson st century wirethe majority of mainstream media reporting surrounding the burns oregon and wildlife refuge occupy protest has ranged from overly simplistic to outright partisan this story is a microcosm of media at its most divisive at its core the narrative has become reduced to the government versus the militia or the government versus the people depending on one s vantage point on average the mainstream media s most neutral narrative is as follows fatherson duo of the hammond ranching family started fires were found guilty went to jail and a bunch of militant and antigovernment militia men don t like what the federal government are doing and used the event to take over a federal building in the malhuer wildlife refuge further to the left the narrative looks more like armed antigovernment gang takes over federal building oregon community in crisis exact words from one mainstream media news anchorfor most of the american media that s a good enough explanation if it fits your political template then that is all good case closed arizona rancher lavoy finicum sits watch overnight with media looking on image credit capital blueap photorebecca boonenews media have become brand shopping do you want quality fun style and value are you loyal to the name pick your poison reporting a story often times becomes the selling of a larger agenda each agenda point with its own outofthebox marketing campaign and the corresponding planning that goes with itthe entire development for major news networks is much easier to navigate and is less confusing than constantly revising varying degrees of moderation and extremism between allegianceswitching groups in the middle eastfor a case closed perspective of the events from the department of justice district of oregon after court rulings on the hammonds in october of read here and stopthe first line of defense is to know that these events rarely if ever spawn up overnight and happen in isolation for a review and thorough sequence of events detailing how the situation has escalated to what it is now read the following from wire hereso is the media reporting events or peddling agendas if they do both maybe no one can tell the differencethings are not that easy and navigating through mainstream news media sludge takes work certainly the white house s guncontrol marketing campaign this week has cast a convenient shadow over events in oregon and in order to forcein outside and unrelated issues the matter at hand must be reduced to a quick and easy account by the mediaone could maintain that oregon s malhuer wildlife refuge the hammonds and militias have all become components for a guided tour on how to think the reason for this is because any number of agendas and unrelated topics have been heaped upon the issue ranging from the presidential race posturing race itself islam terrorism gun control and a host of distractive latchon issuessimplify mattersthe contrasting sides are often setup or at least alluded to immediately this is what public relations operatives and political consultants refer to as framing there are plenty of them working in media now so don t be surprised to see the exact same tactic deployed in politics as is commonplace in today s media industryin today s media barrage the title alone might suffice a quick internet search of various article titles on the subject frame everything at a glancefbi monitoring armed stand off in oregon national wildlife refugearmed group takes over federal building following protest in oregonoregon armed protest leader says group will defend occupied buildingthe narrative is further presented as two sides with contrasting positions choose your position and make your case most americans will have been preconditioned to know where they are supposed to stand and will quickly align accordingly the framing here is usually a binary dialectic or two sides only with no grey area or middle ground a or b republican or democrat liberal or conservative progovernment or antigovernment jedi or sith we all know the drill here they are mainstream media stylethe hammonds victims of overreach by a federal government or rogue ranchers who are above the law with a fondness for starting firesthe bundy s and outside militias lending a hand to fellow ranchers who are too overmatched to fight for themselves or unwanted instigators on a personal antigovernment crusadethe bureau of land management caretakers and stewards of land and resources or the very embodiment of big government imposing its will through a vantage point of official power and authorityoversimplified binary arguments almost never present real events in reality there are two or more sides to a story or event this is what most media outlets do not want you to understand and this is where the art of the delivery comes in by steering the audience to the right choicewhen reporting on the events in question in oregon the mainstream media imply or outright allege that protesters and the militia members who converged on the malhuer wildlife refuge intend to draw first contact and start a shootout as seen later in a cnn clip below the analysis about a triggerhappy militia is pondered endlessly by mainstream news personalities despite repeated statements to the contrary by organizers of the militias in question this is followed by an endless string of pundits and experts expressing their righteous indignation that the federal government can t let these militants get away with this and so onactivists or terroristspart of the process of owning the narrative and shaping public opinion is to define the problem and the people involved with quick and easily identifiable labels among other things this allows the media to avoid doing any real investigation into the core issues and simply surf the partisan wavesin burns oregon this never happened instead the media have labeled the hammonds as arsonists and the bundys as terrorists the mainstream media have worked diligently to characterize the protest s leader ammon bundy photo left son of now iconic nevada rancher cliven bundy as an armed insurgent and a domestic terrorist this is likely do to the fact that journalists are unfamiliar with the fact that ammon bundy has stepped into a political role as a public and state lands advocate since bringing attention to the thousands of ranchers and farmers in the southwestern states facing federal vs state land management issues and has spoken publicly many times since the bundy standoff in viewed through this prism the hammond protest and occupation of the malhuer wildlife refuge is quite obviously a political event but that s not how the media are treating thistoday saw one of the lowest points in partisan media in one of the worst displays of mainstream gutter journalism led by carli brosseau from oregon live who has attempted to senselessly slander the bundys by digging through all the personal records and finances of the bundy sons and other protesters including their businesses loans personal property records and even traffic violations in a clear effort to try and slander them in public for matters not related at all to the public lands issue if only the oregon live and cnn would apply that same level of effort to investigating the government s role in hammond case or for the thousands of other farmers who have been forcibly bankrupted and put out of business over the last two decadeswhat guiltbyassociation words better fit today s on edge atmospherics than terrorists and terrorism these are precisely the terms which media began saturating the internet with moments after this event hit the headlines various leftwing hashtag campaigns like yallqaeda and vanillaisis were strewn all over twitter and have been trending ever since this has provided a soft cushion on which larger media journalists and organizations can comfortably bounce around pejorative terms without receiving too much criticism here s one choice example see tweet hereamazingly even longestablished news organizations such as the washington post have published articles which question why the militia are not called terrorists while fox radio ponders whether or not they are patriots or terrorists the drive for the pejorative label is in full effect this comes as no surprise as the mainstream media have been swimming in confusion the last few years with everfluctuating moderation levels of jihadists based upon what group is being backed by the west or its allies at any given moment however calling an american citizen or group terrorist immediately defines where you stand with regards to protesters or members of the militiacnn gets right after it throws down the gauntlet and calls the militias in question terrorists without hesitation the video below is a typical example of agenda driven news reporting that brings in unrelated issues of race the muslim religion and loosely slapping a terrorist label over what might best be described as breaking and entering through their presentation the event itself slightly matters and the story becomes everything but the event instead of an analysis into how the situation evolved time is spent on painting a good versus bad narrative which is done simply by applying the terrorist label to the militias watch in reality the happy mediums between demands law authority and obedience are more calculus than single digit addition in other words it s complicated and no one hates complications more than media and partisan politicians through polarizing the issue drawing sides and picking a righteous winner cnn sides with its apparent partner in washington and presents the story in such a manner you can even hear the sadness in the voices as they discuss the possibility that the government might wait out the militia instead of coming in with aggressive force and establishing who is boss it might behoove any good journalist or pundit to pause and ask are the various militias in question really terrorists and do their acts constitute terrorismhere is the definition of domestic terrorism and the federal crime of terrorism as delineated by the federal bureau of investigation fbi domestic terrorism means activities with the following three characteristics involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law appear intended i to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ii to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or iii to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the us usc sec b defines the term federal crime of terrorism as an offense that is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion or to retaliate against government conduct and is a violation of one of several listed statutes including sec c relating to killing or attempted killing during an attack on a federal facility with a dangerous weapon and sec relating to killing or attempted killing of officers and employees of the usgranted america seems to be expanding this definition every year as evidenced by the above inclusion of retaliate against government conduct on the list this seems to indicate that any protest can be characterized as terrorism should the government chose to press there those calling these militias terrorists seem to be taking only ii from the above definition of domestic terrorism and are running with it again the fbi states in their own words above that the three characteristics are required nowhere does the fbi say one of the above is terrorism or some of the above is terrorism as champions of the law and enforcing it and assuming care was taken to review the definitions by many one would believe that they meant what they wrote and wrote what they meant the militia is a citizen s right clearly stated in the us constitution but perhaps breaking and entering or unlawfully occupying is not legal but terrorismwhat about committing the federal crime of terrorism from usc united states code sec b above clearly the militias are there openly with guns and stating they will defend themselves if necessary or are they simply there and carrying fire arms within the law yes it is legal to carry a gun in the us the definition might appear to be in the eye of the beholder but from the government s perspective the definition seems highly elasticcnn and the washington post are telling you whom to side with through their narrative and terrorist labels for the militias in questiondepending on how one views the world with regards to the issue along with their ability to process information presented to them determines what side they are on or if they are even on a side who has the bigger agenda and the bigger stake the government or the militias and ranchers is it really about land management andor people management or are both interrelatedlet s start with the land itself as noted in the congressional research service s document federal land ownership the united states governs oversees owns or otherwise has authority and jurisdiction over land primarily through the following agenciesthe bureau of land management blm the forestry service fs the fish and wild life service fws the national park service nps the department of defense dodhere is what oregon looked like with regard to the above agencies and some of their subdepartments in now twenty years ago oregon public lands image wiki commonsthe federal land ownership document cited above also notes that the overall public land managed by the blm has dropped nearly million acres from to however this comes mostly from almost million acres within alaska alone within oregon the state in question the blm alone has gained almost acres to manage from the already colordense map above and is set to takeover another million acres with the their proposed owyhee canyonlands national monument an area larger than yellowstone national park set to be shutoff to the state and placed under blm controlpart of the larger department of the interior doi the bureau of land management s blm mission statement is to sustain the health diversity and productivity of america s public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations according to the blm website they oversee more than million acres and over million mineral and sub surface acres with a multibillion dollar budget and about employees the blm also claims to be one of the few federal agencies that generate revenue based largely on billion dollars of onshore oil and gas development and numerous other land deals brokered by the blmhundreds of millions of acres is vast most people probably see the need for a diligent and upstanding management of it to include the natural resources and wildlife found on the land as well as the resources beneath it understanding that a free for all of destroying resources combined with a full bore resource grab would be adverse many would likely contribute to the oversight of it being entrusted with such a job could be seen as an honorable undertaking by citizens for citizens but when does stewardship and land management turn into territorial control by washington dc which invariably leads to an institutional vendetta or sending a message or becomes a means to define boundaries between authorities and their subjects undoubtedly this is what seems to be happening all over the western states and with small farms being victims picked off one by one by a superior force the federal governmentso the federal government in washington dc is treating state public land as its territory when according to the us constitution it is notwatch as oregon congressman greg walden r delivers an incredibly detailed and impassioned speech on the capitol floor yesterday outlining the scale of this problem in his state many constitutional purists and opponents of federal government over reach and abuse of power argue that the government doesn t really own the land by both the letter and spirit of the law there is a real constitutional case to be made there unfortunately it all quickly turns into a debate on power control and authority between the federal government and the states further complicated by who happens to be in positions of authority for eachthey point to article i section of the united states constitution which authorizes congress to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyards and other needful buildings and they throw out the very premise of government land ownership outside of those parameters the larger issue beyond the hammond family in particular is also centered around jurisdiction literally jurisdiction over land and resources inevitably stem from arrangements involving ownership and control who is in charge of what and to what degree whose goals are ultimately being achieved and who is affected are things all citizens would be wise to ask themselvesare the hammonds being crushed from above in accordance to what they did and were found guilty of and does the punishment fitthe oregonian reports there s nobody in history who has gone to federal prison for burning a few acres of public property said melodi molt a harney county rancher and former president of oregon cattlewomen it s not right the oregon farm bureau said the second prison term is gross government overreach and the public should be outraged and then there is what some locals see as a government land grab the hammonds in late agreed to pay the federal government to settle a lawsuit seeking to force them to pay more than a million in costs for fighting fires they set the hammonds paid right away and paid the rest thursday the settlement also required the hammonds to give the land bureau first chance at buying a particular ranch parcel adjacent to public land if they intended to sell for some this was evidence that the government all along was after the hammond ground to add to its steens mountain holdings the oregonian continues stating that the hammonds originally served jail time starting in under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa the father dwight hammond aged was sentenced to three months and the son steve to one year a possible year sentence according to us district judge michael hogan at the hammonds original sentencing would be unconstitutional and a sentence which would shock the conscience after serving their time both father and son were dragged back in front of a federal bench and resentenced to a full year term in what many believe was just the latest chapter in a federal vendetta against the family waged in part by then us attorney for the state of oregon amanda marshalla new yorker article unabashedly calls the aedpa law one of the worst statutes ever passed by congress headed by bob dole and signed into law by a president president clinton the heart of the law is a provision saying that even when a state court misapplies the constitution a defendant cannot necessarily have his day in federal court so is this the new image of a terrorist breeding ground and rallying point image oregon livethe oregonian wild cards and other subterfugeto be fair not everyone is happy about the outsiders caught in the midst of it all are citizens such as a local resident candy tiller quoted by oregon public broadcasting saying i m worried that there s a triggerhappy idiot out there and maybe a law enforcement officer or somebody else makes a move that makes him think they re pulling a gun and he s going to shoot i don t want that i don t want that for anybody this is crazy this does not fit these people need to go away locals will always feel the tension best and no scenario would play to the establishment and mainstream media narrative better than an wacostyle gunfight and siege also playing out on live television based on the current situation report the federal government would be the one escalating tension by pouring hundreds of assets into the small town and turning the area into a quasimilitary occupation as washington clearly did with bundy ranch in whether it s a greenpeace protest occupy wall street or bundy ranch federal agencies have tried and tested methods besides overt force in order to weaken and ultimately bring down any protest the first method is disinformation a protest leak about a split within the group or rumors about a member of the group wanting to leave this type of manuever might look something like this see the tweet herenext is the dirty tricks phase where a third party leaks personal information of the protesters to the mainstream media in order discredit the protesters and help to break up the groupthe other method of disinformation is a government insider leak designed to scare off other activists from coming to the event but also to jar those inside of the protest and their families and as loved ones look on whether it is true or not is beside the point this type of sensational storyline is designed make its way on to the internet and quickly go viral and might look something like this fbi preparing for wacostyle raid in oregon similarly during the bundy ranch standoff in a slightly more outlandish story was planted in the alternative media about eric holder authorizing a drone strike on bundy ranch not surprisingly the story was complete fiction as wildly unbelievable as that story was it worked incredibly well for the federal government because the bulk of the militia camped out at the ranch a group known as oathkeepers immediately became frightened packed up and leftoathkeepers appear to have released another similar insider leak story last week for the oregon standoff about the pentagon deploying delta force to take back the wildlife refuge which can be found hereanother example could be found in a tweet released at the height of the bundy ranch standoff in claiming that the government had shut down cell phone towers in a communications blackout presumably preparing to attack though this never actually happened one could easily view this as an attempt to scare away members of the public from going to the ranch to support the causebundy family reports cell towers near ranch have been shut down preventing communication video uploads bundyranch paul joseph watson april if the disinformation fails the next level of federal subterfuge is usually to embed or plant a federal informants or agent provocateur s inside of the protest typically this is done very early on in the process but also becomes much easier once more people pour into the area with a patriots unite call to stand with the militias as seen in the below video it s almost impossible for organizers to ever know who could be onsite or what offcentered rebel or individual would simply just show up either to make a name for themselves through media coverage or even worse by starting some serious trouble between activists or with law enforcementin terms of discrediting the protest in the court of public opinion the hammond protest could field no one better than tabloid media mascot like jon ritzheimer of antiislam protesting fame ritzheimer quickly become the mainstream media s target of ridicule and used to discredit any of the other protesters in addition to his armed march on american mosques ritzheimer also tried to grab headlines for traveling to michigan to kidnap or make a citizens arrest as ritzheimer called it of the elderly senator debbie stabenow d because she supported the international iran nuclear dealhere is ritzheimer recording his own martyrdomstyle video before heading into the protest whether this is by design or not the effect is undeniable this exact scenario has already played out in burns oregon with the mainstream media casting ritzheimer in the role of flagwaving xenophobe and militia nutjob with the added knockon effect of painting constitutionalists as mentally unstable militant extremists photo professional media villain and provocateur jon ritzheimeranother prominent militia personality at the oregon protest is blaine cooper also known as stanley blaine hicks like ritzheimer he also acts as a media lightning rod due to his similar performance in a youtube video where he rubs bacon on a copy of the koran before burning and shooting arrows in to it before calling it the most evil pathetic book on the face of the planet unfortunately these media distractions only divert the public from real issues being raised by the hammonds and the bundys and will ultimately be used to discredit their land rights causeonce again more patriot games as the event unfolds many scenarios could happen the worst outcome of events in oregon would be that the hammond family issue loses the spotlight and the public lands issue becomes obscured by a media desperate for a antigun narrative and obsessed with the ridiculous antics of synthetic youtube actors attached to eventonly the craziest of megalomaniac government officials robotic plants or gloryseeking wackos would really want this to escalate led by a depraved sensationalized media and with a public glued to the screen farenheit style with a bag of cheetosread more hammond ranch news at st century wire hammond ranch,0",0

a few years ago teenage pop star justin bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought holocaust victim anne frank would have been a belieber today the yearold president of the united states and his enablers pulled a similarly boneheaded stunt bieber was at the time what s trump s excusevisitors to trump s maralago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend his staff hung banners honoring abraham lincoln by photoshopping a make america great again trucker hat onto the former president s headthis is genuinely hanging in maralago for a dinner honoring lincoln b march the banner went up in conjunction with a republican party of palm beach county dinner to celebrate lincoln day honoring lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments but connecting him to donald trumpthey were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as wellthe cover of the lincoln day dinner program for republican party of palm beach county tonight at maralago andrew lofholm march the only person who might find this stunt in good taste is donald trump who recently learned that abraham lincoln was a republican great president most people don t even know he was a republican right does anyone know a lot of people don t know that we have to build that up a little more the florida republicans hosting the dinner which itself is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it seemed to take trump s idea and run with itthat s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking while it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for years would make of modern life the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a racebaiting grifter like donald trump is hard to picture trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him adding to that the fact that lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps america s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherentlyi mean seriously look at this garbage look having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer dr john trump at mit good genes very good genes ok very smart the wharton school of finance very good very smart you know if you re a conservative republican if i were a liberal if like ok if i ran as a liberal democrat they would say i m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true but when you re a conservative republican they try oh do they do a number it s not exactly four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal if lincoln were alive today he would probably have a really articulate beautiful way of saying donald trump go screw yourself i ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as thatfeatured image via joe raedlegetty images,0

this new information just adds more validity trump s argument that the us needs to take a more serious look at the way we vet immigrants if we want to protect our national security while state department and the us citizenship and immigration service branch of the department of homeland security do ask if immigrants have been involved in terrorism the most well known of over a dozen terrorist groups aren t listed in applications according to the analysis from homeland security expert mark a sauterthe form asks if the applicant has ever belonged to a terrorist group but neglects to ask if they currently belong to one how hard would that be to update he said that federal officials told him that the questions about terror group involvement are required by federal law meaning that congressional action is needed to include modernday threats in the written questionshowever detailed written questions are asked about nazi cooperation as are questions about whether applicants are drunks polygamists or communists one survey does single out colombian terror organizations in the written questions though they have never attacked inside the us the lack of specific questioning about the biggest threat to the united states as the country eyes thousands in line from syria afghanistan iran and elsewhere seeking residency raises new questions about how immigrants are vetted and gives ammunition to republicans like presidential candidate donald trump who has called for extreme vetting to weed out likely terrorists the examiner,0

former white house press secretary in the obama administration jay carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor hillary clinton president obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season but of course like all major political players he has his favorite carney is sure that person is hillary he said to brooke baldwin on cnn i don t think there is any doubt that he wants hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved i think the president has signaled while still remaining neutral that he supports secretary clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee he won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee i think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary smartly the president is refusing to comment on what jay carney has said however he s done all but given an official nod to hillary as the primary race heats up president obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination as we all want a democrat in the white house however he wants hillary to be that person that much is pretty clearit s hard for anybody to speak for president obama of course but his former secretary of state seems to be his pick hopefully we find out for sure in short order but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination especially in a close neckinneck race he must be pretty antsy though being unable to endorse right awayno worries mr president the primaries will be over soon and you can speak your piece thenfeatured image via screen capture from flickr,0

us senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he does not yet know how republicans will amass the votes needed to pass legislation now being crafted to dismantle obamacare but expressed some optimism on another top priority overhauling the tax code in an exclusive interview with reuters mcconnell said healthcare and taxes still top the republican legislative agenda and he added that he will not reach out to the minority democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark mcconnell also said he has not asked the white house for input as the senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the republicanled house of representatives passed its version on may but may do so in the future excluding democratic involvement will leave mcconnell a conservative yearold kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals which are also at the head of republican president donald trumps policy agenda a repeal of obamacare was one of trumps leading campaign promises last year asked about behindthescenes work among senate republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill mcconnell said i dont know how we get to votes at the moment but thats the goal and exactly what the composition of that bill is im not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose mcconnell said republicans hold a senate majority in the event of a tie republican vice president mike pence would be called upon to cast a tiebreaking vote mcconnell opened the interview by saying theres not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare he declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rankandfile republican senators and gauge their support on the other hand he said prospects for passage of major tax legislation were pretty good while this too will be difficult mcconnell said it is not in my view quite as challenging as healthcare trump and his fellow republicans in congress want to cut tax rates across the board but a house proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers the house narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the obamacare law formally called the affordable care act that was democratic former president barack obamas signature legislative achievement overcoming unified opposition from democrats on wednesday the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated the housepassed bill would result in million people losing health insurance coverage by a sobering figure for senate republicans as they mull action the cbo also said federal budget deficits would fall by billion over years under that bill asked if he was getting any guidance from the white house on healthcare legislation mcconnell said honestly i havent asked for any i told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful mcconnell said trump and pence could play an important role when it comes to whipping up support for whatever bill is produced if the senate passes a healthcare bill lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the house and senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to trump for his signature with republicans holding a slim senate majority mcconnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hardline conservative republicans such as senator ted cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral cruz is a member of a working group within the senate in charge of crafting the senate obamacare repeal legislation im grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here mcconnell said republicans face a tricky balancing act because they cannot expect any democratic support and have a razorthin majority they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many republican moderates since it became law in republicans have railed against obamacare arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in americans healthcare decisions they have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most obamacare taxes reduces federal spending in the medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states mcconnell in the past has promised to undo obamacare root and branch now that republicans are in a position to do so with control of both congress and the white house they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan the republican leader compared the effort to solving a rubiks cube many senate republicans have misgivings about the housepassed legislation which democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance benefit the wealthy and roll back obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions mcconnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill saying were working on a separate approach in taking a republicanonly approach to healthcare and taxes mcconnell said of democrats theyre not interested in doing what were interested in doing mcconnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on oct he also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against iran due for debate in the senate foreign relations committee this week and renewal of a food and drug administration userfee program that expires later this year,0
the united states issued about percent fewer temporary visas in march to citizens of seven countries covered by president donald trumps temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year according to a reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on thursday at the same time the data showed that the total of us nonimmigrant visas issued to people from all countries was up by nearly percent in march compared to the monthly average citizens of the seven muslimmajority nations under the bans iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen received about nonimmigrant visas in march compared to about on average per month during the fiscal year and more than on average per month in and trumps travel bans were later blocked by the courts the state department released the data to comply with a directive from trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world the department did not release data on the total number of all types of visa applications so it is unclear whether the lower number of temporary visas for citizens of the seven countries is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors such as fewer applicants or slower processing times a state department official noted that visa demand is cyclical not uniform throughout the year and affected by various factors at the local and international level visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons such as during the summer and the winter holidays the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment march is neither a busy nor slow time for temporary visa issuances to people from the seven countries several immigration lawyers said therefore the significant drops are notable they said the data is preliminary and numbers could be subject to minor revision the state department said previously such data was only available in aggregate by fiscal year and the department declined to break out march visa data from previous years nevertheless some immigration attorneys said the numbers released on thursday provide a glimpse into how trumps policies are affecting visa decisions either there are many fewer people applying because they believe they will be denied or a much higher rate of denials is already happening even though the executive orders have been blocked said william stock president of the american immigration lawyers association trump who has said the travel bans were intended to make americans safer from attacks by terrorists signed an executive order on jan barring people from the seven countries from entering the united states for days the order was blocked by federal courts and the trump administration replaced it with a revised narrower travel ban effective march which dropped iraq from the list courts have also halted parts of the second order the number of nonimmigrant visas issued to iranians dropped to in march from per month on average in according to the data iraqis received such visas in march compared to nearly twice that number per month on average in the data showed iranians also received fewer immigrant visas which are granted to family members of us citizens or those with jobs in the united statesthan the average in previous years received immigrant visas in march compared to on average per month in and nearly on average per month in and although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries two of them saw the number of immigrant visas issued tick up slightly fortyone libyans received immigrant visas in march compared to per month on average in somalians received visas in march compared to on average in immigration lawyers said that although the travel bans have been halted by courts for now the administrations vow to put stricter controls on immigration is likely to have changed how us consulates evaluate visa applicants stephen pattison a former state department consular official now working as an immigration attorney said consulates are going to probably err more on the side of denying some people that theyd be on the fence about anecdotally several usbased lawyers with iranian clients say their visa applications are taking longer to process and are being rejected more often since trump took office on jan they cite shortages of interview appointments for iranians interviews canceled at the last minute and longer administrative processing periods than they are accustomed to if you cant get an interview you cant get a visa said babak yousefzadeh a san franciscobased attorney and member of the board of directors of the iranian american bar association some iranians have decided that for now it is not worth it to risk the expense and time of making us visa applications said kiyanoush razaghi a marylandbased immigration attorney in addition to paying a standard visa application fee iranians must typically travel to turkey armenia or the united arab

sartre st century wireevery day the world moves closer to a nuclear winter the finger on the trigger presses upon the button and only a slight movement will launch unthinkable destructionthe point that it is so unthinkable yet so close to happening is caused by the overwhelming denial that americans have towards the real nature of international brinksmanship the united state foreign policy for global dominance cannot be defended as a righteous imperative those who naively believe that nato occupies the high moral ground are just as confused as the dupes that cheer the dough boys or the gi s in the previous two world warsthe difference in the coming end of days is not that the foolish deployments and menacing circumstances are not known but that the ultimate consequences and inevitable desolation is simply ignored when a nation is oblivious to the lessons of history and the reality of insane actions a rational foreign policy becomes the first causality of national securityevaluate the titanic failures in the middle east iraq egypt libya turkey yemen are well documented as benefiting only a greater israel a stronger iran and a more bellicose saudi arabiayet the major confrontation with russia over the syrian civil war has raised the stakes to armageddon proportions of course the international press wants to avoid any serious discussion on the basis of the so called authority that the united states has to bomb the syrian government back to the stone age or even more important to deflect that russia was invited into the conflict by the president of syria bashar alassad perpetual warfare without declaring a constitutional war has become the norm in the post world war ii environment no doubt there will never be a congressional declaration before the icbm birds fly wwiii is closer to occurring than ever beforedon t be sucked into the militaryindustrialcomplex mindset that russia is the belligerent behind the coming cataclysm remember the actual facts about the coup and who was behind the removal of viktor yanukovych in ukraine read between the lines in this washington post report ousted ukraine president warns of civil war criticizes us for aiding current government yanukovych who read from a statement in russian and did not take questions accused the west and the united states of backing fascists in ukraine another regular allegation being made by russian authorities there is a gang of ultranationalists and fascists operating the government he said i would like to ask those who cover for these dark forces in the west are you blind have you forgotten what fascism is do you recall that nato is encircling russia with an unprecedented military buildup romanian minister us antimissile interceptors will be deployed in and lithuania aims to spend m on airdefense system amid nato buildup in eastern europe and deployment of us missiles in poland antirussian move are just a few examples of nato s expansion into eastern europe with the distinct intention of bringing russia into the globalist new world order sphere of domination is this the end results from obama firing of military reminiscent of stalin s purge or is it a change in military doctrine to employ the george armstrong custer battlefield strategy when taking on the ruskies at least field marshal paulus surrendered at stalingrad sounds like milley will be directing his troops from an undisclosed bunker while the rest of us incinerateif you are still in doubt that the supreme lunacy is upon us read the detailed explanation about the alarming warning signs that indicate war with russia could be imminentthe brick need not be shattered into an irreversible carnage but before levelheaded minds can revamp the tensions from failed policies one needs to understand just what this confrontation is all about can the simple minds of a dumb down society face up to reality or are they satisfied to die in a contrived holocaust because the globalist controlled state department are packed with zionist neocons who are quite willing to endure world war iii to destroy western civilizationmark states it clearly having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not rememberobviously the public does not see the deception nor are they able to perceive the falsehoods from the media propaganda and they certainly do not remember the real nature of the diabolic enemy behind the globalist plan for destroying any nation that opposes capitulation and integration into the new world orderbeing absorbed into the coordinated assault on donald trump the entire establishment exposes itself to be the obedient enablers of the globalist cabal hell bent on eradicating any opposition to their rule if you have not already read national referendum on the globalist establishment please doonce this staged and rigged theater is over the end result will cast the forces of oppression against the populist sentiment to become independent and sovereign the military will not be lead by the mythical brigadier general jack d ripper concerned about maintaining the national precious bodily fluids but will be commanded by modern day air marshal arthur harris who was as much a war criminal as any nazi ss fanatichumanity is systemically stupid people simply cannot bring themselves to admit that their society is ruled by dedicated demonic sociopaths challenging russia on the field of war is about as mad as the very mad strategic nuclear doctrine that the real dr strangelove robert mcnamara pushed to the threshold of annihilationthe single most compelling certainty is that russia has always built their foreign policy around an extensive civil defense network that protects millions of their population the united states has left exposed their entire civilian population as a conscious decision that millions would inevitably be killed in a full exchange of hydrogen bomb weaponsstable cogent and balanced individuals know these conclusions are true regrettably none of us are in the loop of influencing policy much less in positions of authority to reverse the unwarranted confrontation with russiageneral george s patton was correct in advocating deposing stalin and the evil soviet union at the end of wwii but the circumstances are reversed today since the end of those international finance inspired hostilities the american empire has pursued a crusade to do the bidding of the nwo banksters cartel of imperialistsvladimir putin nemesis of the new world order is the overriding motivation for invoking an absurd cause that can only lead to the unthinkable the fact that this outcome has now become conceivable if not alluring illustrates the delusional disease that has taken over the establishment that operates in a fantasy existence of computer simulations and probabilities assessmentsthe military planning scenarios played by the pentagon are infinitely more deadly than playing with the wopr war operation plan response computer in war games president obama secretary of state kerry and an aspiring president hillary clinton are certifiably insane to set into motion a warmongering conflict that threatens all of humanitythe

german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that the european union could only agree to enter the next phase of brexit negotiations in december if britain provided specific assurances about its readiness to settle financial obligations to the bloc speaking to reporters at the end of a twoday eu summit in brussels merkel said it was very clear what british prime minister theresa may had to do to break a deadlock in the talks that has prevented a discussion about britain s postbrexit relationship with the bloc known as phase two we hope that by december we have moved along enough to allow phase two to begin but that depends on the extent to which great britain makes progress so that we can say that it is sufficient on the core themes of phase one merkel told a news conference at the end of an eu summit she said that the main obstacle was britain s failure so far to signal a readiness to settle financial obligations to the bloc that eu officials estimate at around billion euros may under severe domestic pressure after a botched election in june that saw her conservatives lose their majority has said that britain will stand by its financial commitments to the eu without offering figures i think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken merkel said asked about suggestions from may that britain could pursue a twoyear transitional deal once it leaves the bloc in in order to buy time to clinch a more comprehensive agreement merkel said this was not the primary focus for now the twoyear transition phase is an interesting idea no question but it is not part of phase one of the negotiations she said so it is there in the room and will be discussed at the proper time,1

donald trump is a small child in a yearold man s body who somehow managed to get elected president of the united states it seems that world leaders are aware of this and therefore are now devising methods to deal with him as such case in point trump s very first summit with the other member nations of the north atlantic treaty organization natonato officials are well aware that trump has the attention span of a toddler who needs a nap so they are going to keep the topics simple and make sure that any remarks are limited to two to four minute bursts in addition to the shortened speeches and elementary subject matter the summit will have no formal statement after the meeting with the heads of state for the countries in the nato alliance officials in the know say that the people involved in setting all of this up to accommodate trump s childlike ways are really scrambling as the summit is set to commence on may in short they are going to trump proof the event from uproxx it s kind of ridiculous how they are preparing to deal with trump said one source briefed extensively on the meeting s preparations it s like they re preparing to deal with a child someone with a short attention span and mood who has no knowledge of nato no interest in indepth policy issues nothing said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity they re freaking out people are scared of his unpredictability intimidated by how he might react knowing the president might speak his mind or tweet his mind a former official said or as another current senior nato official put it before the meeting we re bracing for impact as if this isn t bad enough a big topic of this particular meeting of the nato alliance will be how to share the costs and other burdens associated with nato of course we all remember how trump actually gave german chancellor angela merkel a bill for supposed monies she owes to nato on her very first visit to our country so there s no telling what he ll say to other member nations on this topic at the summit this worry has not escaped the international officials preparing for this event again from uproxx his views of burdensharing seem to be more ambitious than past presidents and that could become a source of tension at the big nato confab said alexander vershbow former deputy secretarygeneral of nato the burdensharing conversation may not go entirely smoothly this is beyond embarrassing with each passing day trump s childish temperament incompetence and buffoonery lessens america s standing in the world when will the republicans in congress wake up admit they made a mistake by getting this man elected and start preparing to oust him from officeonly time will tell until then resistfeatured image via mark wilsongetty images,1

a recent poll showed that of black voters support donald trump the media is in full panic mode over the very real possibility that trump could win the general in a landslide the only hope they have of stopping him from winning with the black voter is by somehow effectively tying him to the kkk msnbc did their best to do just that in this ridiculous discussion where collectively the hosts made attempts to tie donald trump to the kkk in a span of minutes lyin brian williams opened up the the segment with an immediate tie in to donald trump and the kkkmsnbc republican pundit and fired host of the view nicolle wallace mentioned the kkk in relationship to donald trump four times in less than minutes where she was actually part of the conversation listen i talked to folks today who ve been involved in previous presidential campaigns ken mehlman a former campaign director and former rnc director put out the and they put out the same message about the kkk i don t know that we ve ever gone into a super tuesday where someone was going to clinch the nomination on the heels of his kkk scandal right there s a lot of hope in the sort of in the midwest where his support is very robust that he would actually bring new voters into the electorate but you can t do that if you re acting ambivalent about just how abhorrent the kkk endorsement would have been i think the party could grapple with a policy debate that s not what we re having we re having a walltowall twentyfourseven scandal where the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader has to go before cameras and disavow the kkk watch msnbc cut the sound off when black trump supporter tries to say we re all americans we need to stop the race stuff,1

washington president donald trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the us farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce according to farmers and officials who met with him at a roundtable on farm labor at the white house last month trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas he assured us we would have plenty of access to workers said zippy duvall president of the american farm bureau federation one of participants at the april meeting with trump and agriculture secretary sonny perdue during the roundtable conversation about agriculture farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration the details of which have not been previously reported some farmers told trump they often cannot find americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs according to interviews with nine of the participants they said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the ha visa program the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers the white house declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion but described the meeting as very productive the us department of agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the april meeting about half of us crop workers are in the country illegally and more than twothirds are foreign born according to the most recent figures from the us department of labors national agriculture workers survey during the roundtable luke brubaker a dairy farmer from pennsylvania described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county the employer tried to replace them with local hires but within three hours all but one had quit brubaker told the gathering at the white house trump said he wanted to help and asked secretary perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations according to the accounts while other issues such as trade infrastructure and technology were also discussed participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor than about anything else we talked aboutsaid bill northey a farmer and iowas secretary of agriculture tom demaline president of willoway nurseries in ohio said he told the president about his struggles with the ha guestworker program which he has used for years he told trump the program works in concept but not in practice i brought up the bureaucracy and red tape he said if the guys show up a week or two late it puts crops in jeopardy you are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right while use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade it still accounts for only about percent of the estimated million farmworkers in the country according to government data in the government granted ha visas employers who import workers with ha visas must provide free transportation to and from the united states as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying steve scaroni whose company fresh harvest brings in thousands of

in the united states illegally and speeding up deportations roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce but trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals not farmworkers he has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen said meeting attendee steve troxler north carolinas agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself the farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both shortterm and permanent workers they said there should be a program to help longtime farmworkers without criminal records but who are in the country illegally to become legal residents last tuesday democrats in the house and senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a blue card to protect them from deportation brubaker the pennsylvania farmer said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the presidents support to make it a bipartisan effort the administration has got something started here he said of the meeting with farm leaders its about time something happens,1

donald trumps pick to lead the pentagon put russia at the top of a list of threats to us interests on thursday and told congress that america must be ready to confront moscow where necessary even as he backed trumps bid for better relations the remarks by retired marine general james mattis were the latest by one of trumps cabinet picks that veered away from the presidentelects campaign rhetoric which included praise for russian president vladimir putin and pledges to improve ties with him secretary of state nominee rex tillerson on wednesday also expressed views at odds with trump on key foreign policy issues like nuclear proliferation trade deals climate change and relations with mexico mattis said russia china and islamist militants were presenting the biggest challenge to the usled world order since world war two and called for congress to lift spending caps undermining military readiness im all for engagement but we also have to recognize reality in what russia is up to mattis said adding there were a decreasing number of areas where the united states might cooperate with moscow asked about the main threats to us interests mattis said i would consider the principle threats to start with russia mattis said he wanted to meet with the new trump national security team to craft a strategy to confront russia for what its done when questioned about the possibility of new us sanctions due to enter the white house in eight days trump on wednesday acknowledged that russia likely hacked the democratic national committee and emails of top democrats during the presidential election campaign a conclusion reached by us spy agencies mattis cited russian involvement in hacking and information warfare among the challenges posed by moscow others include treaty violations destabilizing activities abroad and alarming messages from moscow regarding the use of nuclear weapons he also accused russia of trying to undermine nato unlike trump who appeared to question the alliance during his campaign mattis strongly embraced it calling nato central to americas defense we recognize that he putin is trying to break the north atlantic alliance mattis said senator john mccain the republican chairman of the committee said he could not be happier about mattis nomination he warned sternly against optimism about engaging with putin putin wants to be our enemy he needs us as his enemy he will never be our partner mccain exclaimed mattis also singled out china for its activities in the south china sea where it has been building manmade islands with antiaircraft and antimissile batteries together with russian activities and the threats of islamist extremists mattis said china was part of mounting assault on global stability and the relationship with beijing needed to be carefully managed i think it the world order is under the biggest attack since world war two sir and that is from russia from terrorist groups and with what china is doing in the south china sea he said mattis railed against defense spending caps imposed by congress and when pressed said he did not believe the us military was strong enough to properly deter potential adversaries mattis who retired from the military in is technically ineligible for the job since he has not been a civilian for at least seven years that means congress would need to grant him a waiver something it has not done since but appears inclined to do now after mattis testimony the waiver cleared its first hurdle in congress when the senate armed services committee approved it the full senate later backed the waiver by an overwhelming vote reflecting the strong support mattis enjoys in congress mark cancian a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies said he expected bipartisan support for mattis would help him overcome limited opposition the other thing he has going for him is that he may be a restraint on some of trumps more extreme impulses cancian said mattis has tried to persuade trump privately against the use of waterboarding which simulates drowning as an interrogation tactic top us officials many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture trumps pick for cia director took a similar line during his confirmation hearing on thursday saying he would stand firm if necessary against trump on the issue of socalled enhanced interrogation techniques mattis was fiercely critical of iran cautioning that tehrans malign influence in the region was growing iran is the biggest destabilizing force in the middle east and its policies are contrary to our interests mattis said in written responses to the committee still mattis did not echo trumps campaign threat to rip up a nuclear deal between iran and world powers under which tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions mattis said the deal was imperfect but that the united states should uphold it when america gives our word we have to live up to it mattis said,1

"st century wire says in the wake of the friday release of the odni s page report from us intelligence agencies notice how they don t even specify the agency names anymore in these reports on the alleged russian hack of clinton campaign related dnc computers cyber security experts are still not convinced that there is any credible evidence supporting the theorythe feds site the need to keep their sources secret as the reason for the lack of specific evidence of the hacks see full page report embedded at wired in the report but is this a legitimate concern when the forensic evidence is likely located in simple text files and virus protection software logs doesn t the government have the biggest data collection network monitoring facility in the world can the evidence not be shown via server traffic logs that wouldn t expose any sources wired brings some analysis on the page report and cyber security professionals response to it take notice of the language when wired is discussing the other side of this argument referencing unknown sources speaking to the washington post washpost who ve just been caught more than once pushing fake russiaphobia stories in recent weeks andy greenberg wiredon friday the office of the director of national intelligence finally released a declassified report on russia s role in influencing the us election and though it offers the most detailed official analysis yet of russia s operations critics in the cybersecurity community say it lacks the stillsecret evidence needed to persuade skeptics that analysis is truethe odni s page report embedded below from us intelligence agencies lays out a vast russian intelligence operation that extends from hacking both democratic and republican targets to propaganda campaigns to trollfueled social media disinformation it reasserts the intelligence community s findings that the kremlin is behind breaches of the democratic national committee the democratic congressional campaign committee hillary clinton s campaign and even state election board websites and the express intention of those operations the report states was to not only disrupt the american electoral process but to elect donald trump russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process denigrate secretary clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency the report reads we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for presidentelect trump we have high confidence in these judgments even so the report leaves out the much hopedfor technical evidence that informed these conclusions in its scope and sourcing section the report explains that this evidence exists but can t be declassified and that means the report won t satisfy the majority of the cybersecurity community that believes russia hacked democratic targets but has demanded more evidence let alone the diehard deniers of the kremlin s fingerprints seeing more of the context in which this happened does make me a little more trusting that this really was russia says robert graham an analyst for the cybersecurity firm erratasec who has closely followed the russian hacking investigation but knowing what data they probably have they could have given us more details and that really pisses me off knowing what data they probably have they could have given us more details and that really pisses me off robert grahamover the past weeks rumors circulated that senior intelligence officials had pushed for far more of the agencies evidence pointing to russia to be declassified and revealed to the public according to susan hennessey a former nsa attorney but that cardsonthetable approach which likely would have sacrificed intelligence sources and methods in favor of more public transparency didn t make it to the final report this isn t a remotely riskembracing document says hennessey there s alway a tension between those who think it s worth bringing forward sources and methods and those that don t it s clear that those with very conservative views about protecting sources and methods prevailed the unclassified report is underwhelming at best there is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention susan hennessey january one skeptic at least has somewhat altered his viewpoint based on the intel agencies case donald trump after the presidentelect was briefed friday by the heads of the nsa fbi cia and office of the director of national intelligence he offered an oblique statement that neither confirmed nor denied his belief that russia hacked democratic targets while russia china other countries other groups and people are constantly trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions businesses and organizations including the democratic national committee trump s statement reads there was no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines but even that mealymouthed comment no intelligence officials had claimed russia hacked american voting machines contrasts sharply with trump s past denials until now the presidentelect has remained doggedly skeptical and even willfully ignorant of the evidence tying russia s government to the attacks he s blamed the intrusions on everyone from china to a pound hacker in new jersey to the democratic party itself rather than call for investigations into the hacking he s said the country needs to move on at times he has even refused to admit any hacks took place he continued those assertions even after he began receiving classified briefings on the attacks as the republican presidential candidate and then after us intelligence agencies stated that the kremlin was responsible in early october and even after he was elected and gained full access to presidential briefings from the intelligence community as late as friday morning ahead of his own personal briefing on the full report he continued to refer to china as the possible source of the attack and called the investigation into russia a political witch hunt he also wrote on twitter that he s asking congress to investigate the unauthorized early leak of today s report to nbc news showing that he has interest in investigating some leaks at leastthe report makes a few new assertions stating plainly that wikileaks received hacked dnc data from russian intelligence and outlining a broader history of russian meddling in us elections it spends significant ink on russia s statesponsored propaganda efforts and delves into statesponsored social media disinformation strategies and widespread russian media claims that the us is not a functioning democracy the report points out for example that the rt america television channel has been running stories about the us s weak voting infrastructure and alleged election fraud since november rt s role as a distributor for russian government propaganda is hardly news though and while data leaks and disinformation campaigns were central to last year s campaign meddling the report seems to give them disproportionate weight over technical hacking perhaps because those sections of the report were redactedin terms of proving the core claim that russia hacked american political targets though friday s report is sure to leave any skeptic not privy to classified briefings briefings unconvinced it fails to include even the already public evidence visible to the cybersecurity community over the last six months which drew a thick dotted line from the dnc hack to the kremlin a hacker calling himself guccifer for instance in june claimed to be a lone romanian hacker responsible for the breach but the stolen dnc files he published on the web and also said he d leaked to wikileaks contained telltale russianlanguage error messages a piece of malware known as xagent was used in both the dnc hack and previous attacks long believed to be russian intelligence operations and an analysis of the url shortening service used by the hacker who stole the gmail password of clinton staffer john podesta shows that the same account was used to target more than other gmail accounts including russiafocused journalists and authors and the spouses of american military officialsearly leaks from a classified version of the report revealed some of the evidence intelligence agencies have to implicate russia unnamed intelligence officials told the washington post that us agents had intercepted the communications of senior russian officials celebrating trump s win in another leak to reuters intel officials said that they d identified the intermediary who had passed files stolen by russian hackers to wikileaksthe

washingtonspring tx the united states will not make an exception for american companies including oil major exxon mobil corp seeking to drill in areas prohibited by us sanctions on russia treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday the unusually direct statement served to clarify that the united states would maintain a tough stance on sanctions against moscow in consultation with president donald j trump the treasury department will not be issuing waivers to us companies including exxon authorizing drilling prohibited by current russian sanctions mnuchin said in a statement the united states and european union imposed economic sanctions on russia over its annexation of the crimea region in and its role in the conflict in eastern ukraine the sanctions forced exxon the worlds largest publicly traded oil producer to wind down drilling in russias arctic in we understand the statement today by secretary mnuchin in consultation with president trump exxon spokesman alan jeffers said exxon had asked for and received in and waivers to operate a joint venture with russian oil producer rosneft in russia european union sanctions do not keep european oil companies from operating in russia a point of annoyance for exxon the wall street journal reported this week that exxon had in recent months applied for a treasury department waiver to drill with rosneft jeffers said exxon had not applied for waivers from treasury since trump took office any such request would have drawn attention because exxons former chief executive rex tillerson is now us secretary of state under his leadership exxon lobbied congress on russia sanctions and tillerson opposed sanctions against russia in saying they would be ineffective us lawmakers are investigating possible ties between some trump campaign aides and moscow republicans in congress as well as us allies in europe are anxious about any sign that the trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on russia during his confirmation hearing in january tillerson said he never personally lobbied against sanctions and that he was not aware of exxon mobil directly doing so later acknowledging that he spoke to former us treasury secretary jack lew regarding gaps between american and european sanctions on russia tillerson has pledged to recuse himself until the end of this year from any matter involving exxon mobil unless he is authorized to participate he also has until early may to sell his exxon mobil stock us companies frequently file license applications to the treasury department asking permission to undertake activities that would otherwise be barred by sanctions the us government weighs each application based on national security interests the law and other factors the refusal is unlikely to affect exxon mobils bottom line as it has not been able to operate in russia for several years but it does hinder its growth potential treasury almost never comments publicly on license applications mnuchins statement will likely serve to clarify the us stance on sanctions against russia at a time when american allies are looking for clues to us policy observers said its good from a regulatory perspective as it provides clarity to us companies but its also great from a foreign policy perspective edward fishman a fellow at the atlantic council think tank and former state department official during the obama administration said of mnuchins statement any uncertainty about the future of sanctions scares our allies and encourages russia to prolong its aggression in ukraine,1

the morning shows whose morning talk hosts greet their viewers with cheerful dispositions and big white smiles while sticking daggers into our president and his family usa today can be found as in almost every hotel in america as a complimentary source of news for their guestsusa today comes across to the everyday american as a friendly publication that gives americans a snapshot into the latest national news without any bias unfortunately nothing could be further than the truth usa today s stories are so antitrump they should almost come with a warning label for anyone who s looking for honest journalism and unbiased newsan article that appeared today in the usa today talked about the dire financial situation that president trump and his family have caused with their with an unprecedented number of white house protectees shortly after the article was published secret service director randolph tex alles released a statement refuting what usa today claimed he said the quotes in red in the usa today article below are from the secret service director s statementusa today the secret service can no longer pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission in large part due to the sheer size of president trump s family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the east coasthere s what secret service director randolph tex alles said about the secret service running out of money the secret service has the funding it needs to meet all current mission requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year and compensate employees for overtime within statutory pay caps secret service director randolph tex alles in an interview with usa today said more than agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire yearoops it looks like the same thing happened in while barack obama was president the secret service estimates that roughly employees will work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps during calendar year our agency experienced a similar situation in calendar year that resulted in legislation that allowed secret service employees to exceed statutory caps on paythe agency has faced a crushing workload since the height of the contentious election season and it has not relented in the first seven months of the administration agents must protect trump who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in florida new jersey and virginia and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseasto remedy this ongoing and serious problem the agency has worked closely with the department of homeland security the administration and the congress over the past several months to find a legislative solution as we work to ensure that employees are compensated for the hours they work the secret service continues its rigorous hiring of special agents uniformed division officers and critical support staff to meet future mission requirements the president has a large family and our responsibility is required in law alles said i can t change that i have no flexibility the law title us code details protection requirements for the president vice president and their immediate family membersalles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of white house protectees under trump people have protection a number that includes members of his family that s up from during the obama administrationdoes usa today really believe the average american is so stupid that they ve already forgotten about the several separate vacations that the former first lady took while her husband golfed almost every weekend that he was in office what about her notorious trip to spain where she brought most of her entire friends and family list courtesy of the american taxpayersthe people you see surrounding former first lady michele obama on her luxury african safari are michelle s family members yes the american taxpayer paid for her luxury african safari with her brother cousins and of course her mother who lived in the white house for barack s entire year term and traveled to all of their overseas destinations courtesy of you guessed it the american taxpayersurely usa today doesn t believe we ve already forgotten about barack obama s obsession with golf that more than one time took him and his lovely wife to opposite sides of the country to satisfy their individual star travel needsoverwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the secret service ranks yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already donethe compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents from per year to for at least the duration of trump s first termbut even if such a proposal was approved about veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed according to the agency and finally the same secret service director randolph tex alles who allegedly gave usa today the exclusive scoop about how the trump family were draining the secret service funds dry concluded his statement with thisthis issue is not one that can be attributed to the current administration s protection requirements alone but rather has been an ongoing issue for nearly a decade due to an overall increase in operational tempothis isn t the first time usa today was caught fabricating a story to make president trump look bad to their readers in april of usa today was caught fabricating a story about an innocent dreamer

"seoul take the dregs left from making soy bean oil which usually go to feed the pigs press and roll them into a sandycolored paste stuff with rice and top with chilli sauce the dish s name injogogi means manmade meat in north korea for years it was a recipe for survival today it is a popular street food traded alongside other goods and services on informal markets known as jangmadang defectors say there are hundreds of these markets the creation and informal trade of injogogi and other foods offers a window into a barter economy that has kept north korea afloat despite years of isolation abuse and sanctions back in the day people had injogogi to fill themselves up as a substitute for meat said cho uisung a north korean who defected to the south in now people eat it for its taste north korea was set up with backing from the soviet union as a socialist state the soviet collapse in crippled the north korean economy and brought down its centralized food distribution system as many as three million people died those who survived were forced to forage barter and invent meals from whatever they found since people started to use their own initiative studies indicate persontoperson dealings have become the way millions of north koreans procure basic necessities such as food and clothing but the prevalence of informal markets also makes it hard to understand the exact state of the north korean economy and this makes it hard to measure how badly sanctions which do not apply to north korean food imports are hurting ordinary people pyongyang has said the curbs threaten the survival of its children defectors say a poor corn harvest this year has made it hard for people in rural areas to feed themselves the agencies who want to help find all this hard to measure pyongyang says percent of north koreans still use the state s central distribution system as their main source of food the same number of people that the un estimates are food insecure the system consistently provides lower food rations than the government s daily target according to un food agency the world food programme wfp the un uses this information to call on member states to provide food aid for north korea million for nutrition support alone at its last request of which it has received million but surveys and anecdotal evidence from defectors suggest private markets are the main source of supply for most north koreans it becomes sort of ridiculous to analyze food distribution in north korea by focusing on an archaic system that s lost so much of its significance over the past couple of decades said benjamin silberstein an associate scholar at the foreign policy research institute who researches the north korean economy the wfp and the un s other main food aid agency the food and agricultural organization said the un relies on all available information and inputs including official statistics the agencies have a permanent office in pyongyang and make regular visits to public distribution centers farms and occasionally markets in north korea we recognize that the data and their sources are limited but it s the best we have available at present said the un agencies in a joint statement referring to the official north korean government data the agencies said they have seen no sign that more food than needed is delivered to north koreans the main issue is a monotonous diet mainly ricemaize kimchi and bean paste lacking in essential fats and protein the statement said the north korean diplomatic mission in geneva did not respond to questions about how international sanctions might be harming food availability and whether un aid agencies had access to markets in north korea to assess the products on offer last year north korea s economy grew by percent its fastest in years and faster than many developed economies according to south korea s central bank it was helped largely by mining market reforms and dealings with china its neighbor and now the world s largest economy reporters saw signs of chronic hunger in north korea as recently as but people who have defected say the food supply has improved in recent years eight defectors told reuters they ate much the same thing as people in the south asked about the contents of their food cupboards most said they were stocked with privately grown vegetables locally made snacks and rice or if they were poor corn which is a cheaper staple younger and wealthier defectors say they had plenty of meat although it was often seasonal because electric power is too erratic to power fridges pork is common but defectors also talked of eating dog meat rabbit and badger even so on average north koreans are less well nourished than their southern neighbors the wfp says around one in four children have grown less tall than their south korean counterparts a study from said preschool children in the north were up to cm inches shorter and up to kg pounds lighter than those brought up in the south the north s public distribution system pds stipulates that percent of people receive ration coupons to spend at state distribution shops the other percent are farmers who are not eligible for rations because they grow their own vegetables in private plots according to the wfp the pds had been reinstated by defectors say kim jong un who came to power in also quietly loosened the rules on private trade some markets known as grasshopper markets for the speed with which traders set up and take down the stalls are still illegal but there are also officially sanctioned markets where traders are free to buy and sell provided they pay stall fees to the state inventions like injogogi are among foods traded on these stalls it is low in calories but rich in protein and fiber to help muscle growth and keep hunger at bay said lee aeran a chef from the north korean town of hyesan who took a doctorate in nutrition in seoul because it contains so much protein it s also very chewy lee said the sauce can be delicious said cho people who lived by the sea put shredded anchovies in the sauce people living in the countryside used spicy peppers i lived close by shore so i used shredded sand eels the jangmadang are remotely monitored by a website called daily nk a seoulbased operation staffed by north korean defector journalists it said in a report released this august that there are officially sanctioned markets in the country encompassing more than half a million stalls over million people are either directly or indirectly reliant on the markets solidifying their place in north korean society as an integral and irreversible means of survival the report said in a survey of defectors by seoul university professor byungyeon kim found that official channels such as the pds accounted for just percent of people s food intake around percent of respondents said private markets were their most important source of food and the remaining percent came from selfcultivated crops so the official system may mean little to many north koreans wfp has consistently been asking the north korean government to carry out a more detailed study on market activity and the role of markets in achieving household food security a spokeswoman said as in other countries north korea s wealthy have choice residents of the capital can order up a pizza in one of pyongyang s hundreds of restaurants say regular visitors many of the eateries are operated by stateowned enterprises some used to cater only to tourists increasingly they now also collect dollars and euros from locals at a place people know as the italian on kwangbok street for example moneyed locals and western tourists alike can pick vongole pasta for or pepperoni pizzas for the menu says this compares with for a kilo of corn or for a portion of injogogi in the markets reuters was unable to determine how the restaurant sources its ingredients such as pepperoni although north korea imports processed meats and cheeses from european countries and southeast asia such imports are legal calls to the phone numbers on the menu failed and an operator for the pyongyang switchboard said the numbers could not be connected to international lines as the economy in north korea has changed so have the tastes of a moneyed middle class keen to try new foods kim jong un has called for more domestically produced goods according to state media and there are more locally made sweets snacks and candies the country does not publish detailed import data but china s exports of sugar to north korea in january to september this year ballooned to tonnes chinese data shows that is about half of all china s global sugar exports and compares with tonnes in and in north korea does not produce sugar according to the international sugar organization the north s sugar consumption is fairly steady at around tonnes a year a very modest amount per head each south korean consumes about nine times more than that at the other end of the social scale chinese data shows corn exports to north korea also jumped in the first nine months of this year to nearly tonnes compared with just over tonnes in the whole of daily nk reporters say they call secret sources in north korea several times a week to get the market price of rice corn pork fuels and the won currency which is traded at around to the dollar as opposed to the official rate of around to the dollar so far their reports suggest petrol and diesel prices have doubled since the most recent round of un security council resolutions the market price of rice and corn has increased less sharply reuters was not able to independently confirm their reports and there are other ways north koreans can supplement their diets my dad often received bribes said one yearold

the us supreme court on tuesday delivered a major blow to president barack obama by putting on hold federal regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions mainly from coalfired power plants the centerpiece of his administrations strategy to combat climate change the court voted along ideological lines to grant a request by states and various companies and business groups to block the administrations clean power plan which also mandates a shift to renewable energy away from fossil fuels the highly unusual move by the justices means the regulations will not be in effect while a court battle continues over their legality the white house on tuesday night said it disagrees with the court decision but said it expects the rule will survive the legal challenge we remain confident that we will prevail on the merits the white house said adding that the environmental protection agency will continue to work with states that want to cooperate and that it will continue to take aggressive steps to reduce carbon emissions the plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from us power plants by to percent below levels it is the main tool for the united states to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged at un climate talks in paris in december a senior administration official told reporters on tuesday night that despite the courts procedural decision the united states can deliver those commitments and take new and additional steps to lead internationally on climate change the supreme courts action casts doubt on the longterm future of the us environmental protection agencys rule because it increases the chances that the conservativeleaning supreme court would take the case after a lower court issues a decision on the legality of the regulations and ultimately would strike it down as recently as june the high court ruled against the obama administration over its efforts to regulate mercury and other toxic air pollutants the states led by coal producer west virginia and oil producer texas and several major business groups in october launched the legal effort seeking to block the obama administrations plan the states said the emissions curbs would have a devastating impact on their economies west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey described the supreme court action on tuesday as a historic and unprecedented victory over the epa tom donahue chief executive officer of the us chamber of commerce said the high court stay will ensure that america will not be forced to make costly and irreversible implementation decisions based upon an unprecedented regulation until judicial review is complete for obama executing his domestic and international climate change strategy would be a key legacy accomplishment as he nears the end of his time in office in january house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the supreme courts deeply misguided decision to stay the implementation of the clean power plan will enable those states that deny climate science to slow progress in reducing the carbon pollution that threatens the health of all americans house republican leader kevin mccarthy welcomed the supreme courts move saying it has now stopped this illegitimate abuse of power after states revolted against the presidents antienergy agenda the court action also means that with obama leaving office in january the next president will have a say on whether to continue defending the regulation before that the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit which denied a similar stay request last month will hear oral arguments in the case on june and decide whether the regulations are lawful this is certainly a surprise and it suggests the court has serious concerns about the regulation said jonathan adler a professor at case western reserve school of law the brief order from the justices said that the regulations would be on hold until the legal challenge is completed the courts five conservatives all voted to block the rule the order noted that the four liberals would have denied the application under the epa rule each state must submit a plan to comply with its emissionreduction target by september but can also request a twoyear extension the challengers contended that the obama administration exceeded its authority under the clean air act the key law that addresses air pollution more than a dozen other states and the national league of cities which represents more than us cities filed court papers backing the rule jeff holmstead a lawyer for coalpowered utilities that challenged the rule said the court has never before blocked an epa rule to say its unusual is a bit of an understatement holmstead added sean donahue a lawyer for environmental groups that support the law said the court action was surprising and disappointing he added that we remain very confident in the legal and factual foundations for epas rule sam adams us climate director for the world resources institute said fighting to uphold the rule is important to ensure the paris agreement stays intact the benefits of the clean power plan are definitely worth fighting for not only for the united states but the high expectations it hopes to set internationally he said,1

closer to tehran s friends in beirut saudi arabia aimed to hurt iran in lebanon by forcing hariri s resignation on nov and torpedoing his coalition deal with the iranianbacked hezbollah and its allies using its influence over the sunni leader to cause trouble for the shi ite group instead the move backfired as western states censured riyadh over a step they feared would destabilize lebanon despite their shared concerns over the regional role of the heavily armed hezbollah hariri revoked his resignation on tuesday drawing a line under the crisis caused by his announcement from riyadh lebanese officials say he was put under house arrest before french intervention led to his return home riyadh and hariri deny this but while the crisis has abated its causes hezbollah s growing military influence in the region and saudi arabia s determination to counter iran seem likely to bring more trouble lebanon s way sooner or later hariri has identified possible gulf arab sanctions as a major risk to the lebanese economy analysts also see a risk of another war with hezbollah s old foe israel which is alarmed by the group s strength in lebanon and syria the episode also leaves big questions over lebanese politics long influenced by saudi arabia a patron of the lebanese sunni community one senior lebanese politician said the experience had left a big scar on hariri once the the spiritual son of saudi arabia after this it will not be easy to have a normal relationship again meeting on tuesday for the first time since the resignation hariri s government indirectly acknowledged saudi concerns over hezbollah s role outside lebanon at hariri s behest it reaffirmed its policy of staying out of arab conflicts a top lebanese official said western pressure forced saudi arabia to retreat from its lebanon plan but further saudi moves could not be ruled out can we restrain saudi from going toward madness in my view no a western diplomat said saudi measures targeting the lebanese economy were a genuine possibility at some point though the international community would likely try to influence how tough any sanctions would be i think the saudis have understood from the international reaction that lebanon isn t a pitch on which they are playing alone there are other players who have interests who don t want to see those undermined the diplomat said at the same time the international community s patience isn t unlimited it will be hard to protect lebanon indefinitely if there is no tangible progress on rolling back hezbollah hezbollah was the only group allowed to keep its weapons at the end of lebanon s civil war to fight israeli forces occupying southern lebanon its militia has been a source of controversy in lebanon since the israeli withdrawal of with saudi backing hariri led a lebanese political alliance to confront the group but that resulted in hezbollah s takeover of beirut in during a brief civil war hezbollah s stature has grown in the chaos that swept the arab world after it has backed president bashar alassad in syria and helped in the war against islamic state in iraq but its role in the yemen conflict is seen as the main factor behind the crisis in lebanon saudi arabia accuses iran and hezbollah of military support for the iranianallied houthis in their war with a saudiled coalition hariri has repeatedly flagged yemen as the cause of the latest crisis and warned that lebanon s economy is at stake the economy depends on remittances from expat workers particularly in the gulf any threat to inflows is seen as a risk to the system that finances the heavily indebted state hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah has appeared to recalibrate his rhetoric in response to the crisis last month he denied his group was fighting in yemen or sending weapons to the houthis or firing rockets at saudi arabia from yemeni territory he also indicated hezbollah could pull its fighters from iraq the remarks on the eve of hariri s return were seen as appeasing a source close to hariri said hariri has twice led coalition governments including hezbollah despite his enmity toward the group five hezbollah members have been charged by a unbacked tribunal with the assassination of his father rafik alhariri hezbollah denies any involvement hariri s willingness to compromise with hezbollah was a factor behind the saudi move against him and has drawn criticism from within the sunni community his status as lebanon s most influential sunni will be put to the test in parliamentary elections next year ashraf rifi a hawkish sunni politician said the way hariri reversed his resignation was a farce and a surrender to the hezbollah project the senior politician who spoke on condition of anonymity said hezbollah may offer hariri a gesture over its regional role but saw little prospect of the group fundamentally changing course president michel aoun a political ally of hezbollah could pressure the group a little bit to be cooler on certain issues the politician said but lebanese in saudi arabia still had reason to be afraid for their livelihoods i think with time the lebanese will try to disentangle themselves from saudi arabia but this will cost lebanon a lot because revenues will be reduced the hariri crisis marked an unprecedented intervention in lebanon even in a country with a long history of foreign meddling it also underlined the different priorities of saudi arabia and its western allies in lebanon a major recipient of aid to help it host million syrian refugees on the last day of hariri s stay in saudi arabia saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman summoned him for a meeting and kept him waiting for hours delaying his departure for france where president emanuel macron was waiting for him the senior politician and a top lebanese official said macron was calling saad to find out where he was said the senior politician adding that macron then called crown prince mohammad to tell him he was expecting hariri for lunch western states want stability in lebanon the politician said they need lebanon as a platform for observing the arab world they have invested a lot here and if there is a civil war there is the question of what to do with all the syrian refugees,1
